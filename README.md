### E-Commerce E-Delivery Platform
This project is a full-stack solution for an e-commerce platform with a delivery service. It consists of a relational database for data storage and a RESTful API built with FastAPI and Python for managing that data.

## Database Schema
The database is named `deliverDB` and consists of the following tables, designed to store and manage key business entities and their relationships.

`Vendors`: Stores details about the businesses selling the products.

`Customers`: Contains information about the users placing orders.

`Drivers`: Manages the details of the delivery personnel.

`Products`: Holds information about all the products available for sale.

`Orders`: Records each customer order, linking it to a specific customer and driver.

`OrderItems`: This is a linking table that resolves the many-to-many relationship between Orders and Products.

## API Endpoints
The API is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database tables.

The following endpoints are available for the Customers entity:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/customers/	Creates a new customer record.
GET	/customers/	Retrieves a list of all customers.
GET	/customers/{customer_id}	Retrieves details for a single customer by ID.
PUT	/customers/{customer_id}	Updates an existing customer's details.
DELETE	/customers/{customer_id}	Deletes a customer record.

## Export to Sheets
Note: Endpoints for the Products entity would follow the same pattern.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.7+

A MySQL server

The project files from this repository

# Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to set up and run the entire project.

Database Setup:

Ensure your MySQL server is running.

Execute the database_schema.sql file to create the DeliveryDB database and all its tables.

Optionally, execute the dummy_data.sql file to populate the tables with sample data.

## API Setup:

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal (the folder containing main.py).

Install the required Python packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open database.py and update the DATABASE_URL with your specific MySQL credentials.

Run the Application:

Start the FastAPI server from the terminal.

Bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload flag will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.

## API Documentation
Once the application is running, you can view and test all the API endpoints directly in your browser. The API's documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using Swagger UI.
