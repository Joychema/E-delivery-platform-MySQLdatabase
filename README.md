# E-Commerce E-Delivery Platform
This project is a full-stack solution for an e-commerce platform with a delivery service. It consists of a relational database for data storage and a RESTful API built with FastAPI and Python for managing that data.

## Database Schema
The database is named `deliverDB` and consists of the following tables, designed to store and manage key business entities and their relationships.

`Vendors`: Stores details about the businesses selling the products.

`Customers`: Contains information about the users placing orders.

`Drivers`: Manages the details of the delivery personnel.

`Products`: Holds information about all the products available for sale.

`Orders`: Records each customer order, linking it to a specific customer and driver.

`OrderItems`: This is a linking table that resolves the many-to-many relationship between Orders and Products.

## API Endpoints
The API is built to perform the four core CRUD operations on your data. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each endpoint does:

`POST /customers/`: Creates a new customer. You send the customer‚Äôs details, and the API adds them to the database.

`GET /customers/`: Retrieves a list of all customers from the database.

`GET /customers/{customer_id}`: Reads the details of a single customer by using their unique ID.

`PUT /customers/{customer_id}`: Updates an existing customer‚Äôs information. You provide the customer's ID and the new details to modify their record.

`DELETE /customers/{customer_id}`: Deletes a customer record permanently from the database using their ID.


üìå Note: Endpoints for the Products entity would follow the same pattern.


### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

‚óè Python 3.7+

‚óè A MySQL server

‚óè The project files from this repository

## Setup and Usage
#### Follow these steps to set up and run the entire project.

### Database Setup:

‚Üí Ensure your MySQL server is running.

‚Üí  Execute the `database_schema.sql` file to create the `deliverDB` database and all its tables.

‚Üí Optionally, execute the `dummy_data.sql` file to populate the tables with sample data.

### API Setup:

‚Üí Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal (the folder containing main.py).

‚Üí Install the required Python packages:

##### Bash

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

‚ñ∂ Open `database.py` and update the `DATABASE_URL` with your specific MySQL credentials.

Run the Application:

‚ñ∂ Start the FastAPI server from the terminal.

##### Bash

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

‚úî The --reload flag will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.

## API Documentation
Once the application is running, you can view and test all the API endpoints directly in your browser. The API's documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using Swagger UI.
